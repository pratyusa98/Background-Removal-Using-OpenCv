# Background-Removal-Using-OpenCv
Code For Change Background Using Opencv

We live in the era of video calls. Conducted over the internet and using whatever camera that comes with your laptop or computer, we broadcast our lives to our classmates, coworkers, and families.
Sometimes, though, we don’t want to broadcast our space. My office, like many others, has a few perennial pieces of clutter. I also have a guitar on the wall behind me, which doesn’t always scream professionalism.
As a result, Zoom and other video calling software includes a feature to hide your background, usually behind an image of your choice. While most don’t think of it much, the actual task of determining what determines the foreground and the background in an image is hardly trivial.

Technology Used:

    1. Opencv
    
    2. Mediapipe
    
    3. cvzone
    
    4. SelfiSegmentation
 

Results: 

output window should be created displaying real-time background removal. While the algorithm here works well enough for very simple background, it may have more trouble distinguishing more complex backgrounds that are “busy” or cluttered. Overall, however, it works well enough to demonstrate the concept.
The below gives the ideal case, where I stand against a plain white wall:

By Press A SHow Next Image in Background And By Press D Show Previous Image. Here I Use 4 Image For Demonstarte. You Can Use Any Number Of Image.

Output:
